                  <div class="content">
                      <p>Standard delivery is available in all EU countries, as well as the UK (except for Greece and Cyprus). The standard delivery service is provided via Budbee, DHL or local carriers via SevenSenders where the last mile delivery may be carried out in collaboration with your local postal service (depending on your market).

                        Usually, orders are delivered to the door. If the carrier is unable to deliver the parcel, it will either be taken to a service point for pickup, or a second delivery attempt is made the day after. A change of delivery method may be available when the parcel has been dispatched, depending on your location and selected shipping option. For example, you might be able to choose to have the parcel delivered straight to a service point or neighbor, left in a safe place, or select a different day of delivery.
                        
                        Please note that parcels are commonly delivered during the day. Therefore we recommend having the parcel shipped to your work address if applicable to you</p>

                  <div class="content">
                      <p>As a result of the current pandemic, air freight is limited. DHL Express orders may therefore be subject to delays.

                        Express shipping is always carried out via air freight, meaning it is both more expensive and hasa considerably larger environmental impact than standard shipping has. We hence recommend that you to use the standard delivery option when available. We aim to provide as environmentally responsible shopping as possible in all markets, which is why we are looking to change the shipping options in markets where express delivery currently is the sole option.
